        " In natural language processing (NLP), text data often undergoes preprocessing steps\n",
        "like encoding specific characters. You are tasked with encoding vowels in a string by replacing\n",
        "them with numbers: a becomes 1, e becomes 2, i becomes 3, o becomes 4, and u becomes 5. This\n",
